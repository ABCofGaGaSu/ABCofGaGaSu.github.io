# Cup-to-Disc Ratio Calculation
### ID: CDR
Cup-to-disc ratio is an important indicator for early glaucoma detection. Typically, it starts from extracting the termination of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. However, it is hard to complete only by traditional image processing. So, we proposed an deep learning based method to automatically detect the NCOs on an OCT image.
