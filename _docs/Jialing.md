# Using Deep Learning for Automated Detection of Neural Canal Opening in OCT Images
### ID: CDR
Cup-to-disc ratio is an important indicator for early glaucoma detection. Typically, it starts from extracting the neural canal opening in the OCT image. However, it is hard to be completed only by traditional image processing. So, we proposed an deep learning based method to automatically detect the NCOs on an OCT image.
