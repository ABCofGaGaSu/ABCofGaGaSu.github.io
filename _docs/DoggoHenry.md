# Automatic Pixel-wise Logo and Banner Segmentation Algorithms
### ID: logo
Accurate logo and banner segmentation are crucial for various applications, including local dimming algorithm for OLED displays, and even for video content classification and understanding. The proposed algorithm efficiently segments logos and banners for common seen TV images. Deep networks and conventional image processing techniques (edge detection, morphology, GrabCut) are applied. In addition, temporal information is considered in this algorithm to achieve high quality segmentation output.
